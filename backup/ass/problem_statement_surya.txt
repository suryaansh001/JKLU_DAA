Problem Statement: Tourism Recommendation System

Title: "Personalized Travel Recommendations Using Graph-Based Destination Analysis"

Background:Tourists often struggle to find the best travel routes, attractions, and experiences based on their interests, budget, and available time. Generic travel platforms fail to provide personalized and optimized itineraries, leading to suboptimal travel experiences and missed opportunities.

Problem Definition:Given a network of tourist destinations, hotels, restaurants, and travel routes, we aim to develop a graph-based recommendation system that:

Suggests optimized travel routes based on budget, time, and user preferences.

Recommends places of interest based on historical data and user similarity.

Provides real-time updates on traffic, weather, and availability.

Identifies hidden gems and offbeat locations that users might not typically explore.

Proposed Approach:We model tourism as a graph, where:

Nodes represent cities, attractions, hotels, restaurants, and transportation hubs.

Edges represent travel routes (roads, flights, trains, ferries).

Weights are determined based on distance, cost, user ratings, popularity, and travel time.

Using algorithms like PageRank, Collaborative Filtering, Shortest Path (Dijkstraâ€™s/A), and Community Detection*, we provide personalized travel recommendations and itinerary planning.

Expected Outcome:

Highly optimized travel plans tailored to individual preferences.

Improved user satisfaction through personalized and efficient travel recommendations.

Boost in tourism revenue by promoting lesser-known destinations.

Minimized travel costs by suggesting cost-effective travel routes and accommodations.
